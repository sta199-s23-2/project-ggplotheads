The study involves collecting data on the year of the Olympics, the event in which the medal was won, the type of medal won, and the country the athlete was representing. Research will identify patterns and trends in medal-winning performances across different countries, events, and time periods. We hypothesize that more populous countries, and younger participants will achieve more wins each year in the Winter Olympics.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\nThe variables represented are all categorical variables. This includes the countries, athletes, events, and years."
